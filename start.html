<p align="center"><b>Saturday, June 21</b></p>

<p align="center"><em>gun.</em></p>

<p>Laying on my side in bed with my eyes half shut, I can just barely see the corner of the blue plastic case on top of my dresser across the room.</p>

<p>And it gives me a strange and wondrous feeling to know that inside the case, resting on a gray foam cushion, is a
 brand new Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum pistol, still covered with the lightest sheen of oil</p>

<p>And in the final moments before I drift off to sleep, I try to decide what will be the easiest and least painful way to use that dangerous hunk of steel and gunpowder.</p> 

<p>To kill myself.</p>
<p align="center">* * *</p>
<p>To get an accurate picture of the position I am in, you should know that it is seventy degrees in 
	my bedroom because I like it cold, yet I am toasty warm under a blanket and a thick down comforter, 
	with just the tip of my right foot peeking out from the covers, a thermometer to test the coolness of 
	the air outside the covers. My head is resting on one of those special foam pillows that when you place 
	your hand hard on the surface it leaves a full palm print.</p>
<p>All in all, I am quite content and quite happy.</p>

<p>I live in a very big house. It is midnight and my wife, who always goes to bed after me, is in one of
the other rooms, either surfing on her laptop computer or watching one of the dozens of tennis matches
she tapes and plays over and over. When she calls it a night, she will sleep in the guest room because I
snore, quite loudly and frequently apparently. My daughter recently graduated from college and lives in
New York City. Her older brother lives across town. We have an empty nest. There are two new BMWs
in our driveway and a 65-inch plasma TV in the living room and plenty of money in the bank.
I want for not, need for not.</p>
<p>And still I think about that gun just a few yards away.</p>
<p>And about taking my own life.</p>

<p>The gun seems so out of place in this gated golf course community where crime is nonexistent and
the outside world is kept at bay by multiple security gates staffed by gray-haired, pot-bellied rent-a-cops
who insist on waving a hello at every car that comes through the gates. The only voices that are ever
raised in anger are from golfers on the nearby greens arguing about side bets and golf shots. It's too
light in the bedroom for my tastes, the blue light from the remote oscillating floor fan, the red and green
lights on the cordless phone, and the swath of white light that slips around the corner through the French
window on the closed bedroom door, even though we spent hundreds of dollars on some fancy blinds
that look great but are too sheer to keep out the light from the living room.</p>

<p>On the other side of my dresser is a hallway flanked by two large walk-in closets leading to a
large bathroom with the requisite sunken bathtub and separate tiled shower. There are two vanities in
front of a huge wall-to-wall mirror topped by sixteen of those round lightbulbs like you see over mirrors
in backstage dressing rooms. I know that when I decide to use the gun, that mirror will come in handy
because it is imperative that you see exactly where the gun is pointing before you pull the trigger. I was
a crime reporter for newspapers twenty-five years ago and wrote my fair share of news stories about
botched suicide attempts, guys blowing off an ear or a chunk of their scalp because they did not have the
barrel of the gun pointed at the right angle against their head or because they flinched at the last second.
There are two schools of thought on the best way to point the gun, and I would often hear the cops
at the police station argue back and forth on the pros and cons of those two different approaches. On
one side were the cops who said you should place the barrel of the gun under your chin and dispatch that
hot piece of fragmenting lead straight up through the top of your head. On the other side of the fence
were the cops who favored placing the barrel to your temple and letting the bullet go from one side of
your head to the other side on a nice even parallel line.
Horizontal suicide or vertical suicide?
Such a dilemma.</p>

<p>For me, the gun is less than twelve hours old.</p>

<p>I bought it earlier today on what was a sunny Sunday afternoon at one of those gun shows that
take up a weekend and draw hundreds of you-can-have-my-gun-when-you-pry-my-cold-dead-finger-
off-the-trigger local yokels to the community convention center. One weekend it's the miniature train
collector's show and the next weekend the tables are packed with enough firepower to arm a small South
African army. What's scary is that the two shows are drawing the very same people.</p>


<p>When I lived in Texas a few decades ago, I would drive by a small strip shopping center on the way
to work every day and in that shopping center was a store with two big plate glass windows on either side
of the front door. Painted on the window on the left side of the door were the words Comics for Sale, and
painted on the window on the right were the words Guns for Sale.</p>


<p>Superman comics and Saturday night special handguns in the very same store. What a novel
idea. Sell to father and son at the same time and once the son gets his fill of make-believe cartoon
violence he can move up to the real deal-and still buy from the same smiling clerk. I mentioned this
jarring mix of retail products to several friends who were surprised that I saw anything unusual about the
situation. Granted, these were the same homegrown boys who, along with every other male in the South
at that time, owned a pick-up truck with a shotgun openly displayed in a gun rack in the back window, just
in case a deer happened to wander past the stoplight where they were waiting for the light to change.
I had not owned a gun for over two decades.</p>

<p>Because for the past twenty years I had my children in the house.</p>
<p>And I knew what could happen.</p>

<p>The first person I ever saw die was a ten-year-old kid who was accidentally shot in the chest with a
12-gauge shotgun by his older brother ...</p>
